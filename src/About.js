          My full name is Ellaine Tolentino. Pronouns She/They. I am a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, a first generation Filipino here in the US and I love building and seeing projects come to life that can impact someone's life anywhere in the world! I find Software Engineering as a very powerful tool because it aligns with user experience and creativity. Front-end Development is my favorite! I am looking forward in producing creative and interesting products that will serve as a great contribution to the community. I am also trying to learn more of data structures and practice alot more algorithms!
